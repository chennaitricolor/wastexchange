          The Government of India has launched the Smart Cities Mission on 25 June 2015. The objective is to promote sustainable and
          inclusive cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable
          environment and application of ‘Smart’ Solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at
          compact areas, create a replicable model which will act like a lighthouse to other aspiring cities. The Smart Cities Mission is
          meant to set examples that can be replicated both within and outside the Smart City, catalyzing the creation of similar Smart
          Cities in various regions and parts of the country.
